Such patients generally experience poor care quality, but account for a disproportionate share of Medicare spending. AIM addresses these issues through a complex medical home model that uses nurse-led interdisciplinary teams to coordinate and deliver care that encourages patient self-management of chronic illness that modifies disease course and provides symptomatic relief. The goals of the program are to improve care and patient quality of life, increase physician, caregiver, and patient satisfaction, and reduce Medicare costs associated with avoidable hospital stays, emergency room visits, and days spent in intensive care units and skilled nursing facilities.",Initiatives to Accelerate the Development and Testing of New Payment and Service Delivery Models,Ongoing,Health Care Innovation Awards,http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/participant/Health-Care-Innovation-Awards/Suttercare-Corporation.html,2

MPBH supports the CMS goals of better health, better care, and lower cost by assisting beneficiaries to address social service needs and link them to preventative health care services.  MPBH is based on the Pathways Community HUB Model developed by Drs. Sarah and Mark Redding of the Community Health Access Project (CHAP). Community Health Workers (CHWs) are trained and deployed to assist Medicaid and/or Medicare adult beneficiaries with two or more chronic conditions with health and social service needs (such as primary care, housing, food, and transportation). In other states, the model has improved health outcomes and lowered healthcare costs.  Three high-need counties (and selected adjacent counties) are served: Ingham, Muskegon and Saginaw. In each county, a number of organizations work together to implement the model. The Lead Agency is the fiduciary, managing contracts and finances, and providing project oversight.  Referrals to the program are made by healthcare providers, social service agencies, CHWs, and other community agencies. The Pathways Community HUB conducts outreach, accepts referrals, determines client eligibility, enrolls clients and assigns clients to a Care Coordination Agency (CCA). The HUB also manages the IT function, provides quality monitoring and improvement, and reports on outcomes to the CCAs and the community. CCAs deploy and manage the CHW workforce, receiving assignments from the HUB.  Partners work together to identify, recruit, and train CHWs who live in the community. Before serving clients, CHWs receive training based on a curriculum developed by Dr. Sarah Redding. As CHWs work in the field, they are mentored by experienced CHWs and supervised by a registered nurse and/or social worker. CHWs do not provide direct healthcare or human services, but link clients to these services.  Over three years, MPBH will employ 75 CHWs and serve over 13,000 clients. The project will demonstrate the role of CHWs and Pathways Community HUBs in improving health outcomes and chronic disease management, while lowering healthcare costs by an estimated $17,498,641.",Initiatives to Accelerate the Development and Testing of New Payment and Service Delivery Models,Ongoing,Health Care Innovation Awards,http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/participant/Health-Care-Innovation-Awards/Michigan-Public-Health-Institute.html,60

Our goal is to create a sustainable infrastructure that robustly delivers evidence-based cost-effective asthma care to New England children with severe disease, and creates viable Medicaid reimbursement mechanisms to support these programs over the long-term. The targeted population is high-cost Medicaid and CHIP pediatric patients (2 – 17 years), with a focus on those with uncontrolled symptoms that have a history of using expensive urgent care. NEAIC includes following components: 1. Workforce development:  NEAIC will: a) sponsor Asthma Training to increase the number of well qualified cost-effective providers, including certified asthma educators (AE-Cs) and community health works (CHWs) with a specialty in asthma; and b) explore CHW asthma credentialing program that payers and provider practices across NE have requested and can benefit from. All of this will contribute to higher quality and culturally competent care, and we believe will help to support innovative Medicaid reimbursement as a result of demonstrated cost-effective outcomes. 2. Rapid service delivery expansion for over 1300 high-risk children with asthma in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Vermont. NEAIC employs the following components of care: 1) Asthma self-management education 2) Home environmental assessment with the provision of minor-to-moderate environmental intervention supplies to reduce asthma triggers; and 3) Use of non-physician providers shown to be cost-effective deliverers of this level of care, particularly community health workers (CHWs) and certified asthma educators (AE-Cs).   3. Committed Medicaid payers in several New England states will work to sustain these programs by piloting reimbursement methodologies with the service providers, should the service model results demonstrate the goals of delivering better health, improving care and lowering costs.. 4. A Payer and Provider Learning Community across all six New England states to rapidly disseminate demonstrated improvements to the quality and cost of asthma care, share viable reimbursement systems developed, successfully incorporate CHWs into the asthma care team, and disseminate best practices. The Learning Community builds on ARC’s existing networks and partnerships across the region, and is meant to increase awareness about these successful models with the goal of broader adoption across New England.    NEAIC’s components build in continuous quality improvement measures through rigorous data collection/analysis, strong partnerships, and commitments from interested payers and policy makers. The establishment and promotion of CHWs as strong health care delivery partners addressing environmental conditions as part and parcel of the disease management program, with reimbursement by payers, make this an innovative model for broad dissemination and potential for replication across the nation.",Initiatives to Accelerate the Development and Testing of New Payment and Service Delivery Models,Ongoing,Health Care Innovation Awards,http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/participant/Health-Care-Innovation-Awards/Health-Resources-In-Action.html,65

The intervention also increases coordination of services by integrating care with community support services and local government initiatives to provide healthier environments for children with asthma in schools, child care centers, and housing, and by deploying community health workers to serve as patient navigators and provide case management services to families with high needs. The goal of this model is to reduce asthma-related emergency room use and asthma-related hospitalization among pediatric Medicaid patients in Delaware by 50% by 2015 with incremental declines in 2013 and 2014.

These four components are INTERACT (Interventions for Reduce Acute Care Transfers), POLST (Provider Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment), palliative care and enhanced discharge planning. INTERACT is an evidenced-based process for reducing hospitalizations from nursing homes by improving communication among caregivers and between the nurse and medical provider. INTERACT empowers nursing assistants to recognize and report changes in patient and residents’ condition and promotes concise and thorough communication between the nurse and medical provider when relaying changes in patient and residents’ condition. POLST encourages informed decision-making about goals of care and desired treatments and makes these patient and residents’ goals and desires actionable physician orders for care providers. Palliative care is an approach that endeavors to provide care consistent with the patient and residents’ defined goals of comfort, pain and symptom relief. It increases quality of life for people with chronic or life-threatening illnesses. The proposed enhanced discharge planning process includes using evidence-based components of Project RED (Re-engineered Discharge) and available technology to create an efficient system for nursing home staff to do the comprehensive education and preparation needed by patients and families to promote a successful patient and residents’ transition from care setting to home. Together, these four components of care have proven effective in reducing hospital admissions, enabling patient determined goals of care and improving palliative care for the patient and residents’ of CareChoice nursing homes over the past three years.
